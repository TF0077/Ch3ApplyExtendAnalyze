            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>Descriptive file names for images is always important because it allows the programmer to know what the purpose of the image is within the website</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>I used Paint to change the image size.</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The image was originally 2121 by 1414 pixels</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5.jpg" alt = "hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height = 333 width = 500>
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>I used compressor.io. The original file was 27kb but the new one is 7kb</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5_min.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height = 333 width = 500>
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>The compressed image is grainier where there are areas with large amounts of detail. This is most noticeable on the hand.</p>

                <h3>SVG Graphics</h3>
                
                <!-- Insert your SVG code below this comment -->
               <svg width="100" height = 100>
                <rect x="10" y="10" width = "80" height = "60" stroke = "red" stroke-width="4" fill = "yellow" />
               </svg>
                
                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
                <p>I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a> to teach me to use svg's to fill in certain areas.
                I will admit I do not understand them that well, but I grasp the basic concept</p>
